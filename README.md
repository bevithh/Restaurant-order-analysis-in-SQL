# Restaurant-order-analysis-in-SQL
In this project, I used SQL to analyze and manipulate restaurant order data, extracting key insights to support better business decisions. The goal was to understand customer preferences, pricing trends, and revenue drivers to help optimize menu offerings and pricing strategies.

Business Need:
Restaurants need data-driven insights to stay competitive, improve profitability, and enhance customer satisfaction. This analysis helped answer critical questions, such as:

Which dishes are the most and least popular?
What are the most and least expensive items on the menu?
Which orders had the highest total spend?
How do different menu categories contribute to overall sales?
Approach & Insights:
I used SQL queries to explore the dataset, joining tables (menu items and order details) to gain a comprehensive view of sales and spending trends. I identified the best-selling and lowest-performing items, calculated total revenue from individual orders, and analyzed price distribution. These insights help restaurants refine their menu, adjust pricing, and maximize revenue by focusing on high-performing items and optimizing their pricing strategy.
